    "\n",
    "The AWK programming language is truly one of the classic tools used in Unix. It dates back to the very earliest days of the Unix tradition. It was originally developed in the late 1970's at Bell Telephone Laboratories by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. The name \"AWK\" comes from the last names of the three authors. It underwent major improvements in 1985 with the release of nawk or \"new awk.\" It is that version that we still use today, though it is usually just called awk."

    "## So, What's It Good For?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though AWK is fairly general purpose, it is really designed to create filters, that is, programs that accept standard input, transform data, and send it to standard output. In particular, AWK is very good at processing columnar data. This makes it a good choice for developing report generators, and tools that are used to re-format data. Since it has strong regular expression support, it's good for very small text extraction and reformatting problems, too. Like sed, many AWK programs are just one line long.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, AWK has fallen out of fashion, being supplanted by other, newer, interpreted languages such as Perl and python, but AWK still has some advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    " - It's easy to learn. The language is not overly complex and has a syntax much like the C programming language, so learning it will be useful in the future when we study other languages and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    " - It really excels at a solving certain types of problems."

    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    " - Operates on a single `record` at a time\n",
    " \n",
    " - A `record` is a single line of text terminate by a newline character `\\n`\n",
    " \n",
    " - Each `record` is separated into `fields`, which by default are separated by white space\n",
    " \n",
    " - Fields are given numeric variables: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, `$4`, `$5`.....and so on and so on.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The field `$0` is special and representes the entire `record`."
